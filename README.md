# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the project:
For this project we developed an algorithm using Python and Jupyternotebook to determine which low budget movies will become popular so that any company can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. We used several modules in this script, including: Json, Pandas, Numpy, Re, Sqlalchemy, Psycopg2 and Time.
